## How to Use

1. Navigate to the relevant year and day folder for the challenge you want to view or solve.
2. Solutions may be in different languages (e.g., C++, Python).
3. Test files are provided for validating solutions.

## Running Tests

- Python tests can be run using `pytest` or directly with Python.
- C++ solutions may require compilation (e.g., using `g++`).

## Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of programming challenges for a variety of skill levels and languages.
