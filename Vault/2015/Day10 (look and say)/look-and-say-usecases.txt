1. Data Compression / Encoding
    - Forms the basis of run-length encoding (RLE)
    - Useful for compressing repeated sequences in text, images, or sensor data

2. Pattern Recognition
    - Detects repetitions in sequences
    - Applicable in DNA/RNA motif analysis and bioinformatics

3. Algorithmic Education
    - Teaches recursion, loops, and self-describing sequences
    - Useful for coding exercises and algorithm practice

4. Testing Compression Algorithms
    - Generates structured, repetitive sequences to benchmark compression

5. Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
    - Helps encode runs of repeated signals efficiently
    - Optimizes storage for repetitive sensor or signal data
    EX: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1] ---> 31 20 21 (3 ones, 2 zeros, 2 ones)

6. Novelty & Cryptography
    - Generates pseudo-random-looking sequences
    - Can be used in puzzles, games, or simple obfuscation
